Reminder! Software is currently in BETA. Bugs may be encountered.

Castlevania Symphony of the Night Area Randomizer. This utility program will randomize the doors you travel through to lead to different areas. Various other changes are made to improve the gameplay experience. Several options exist for the user to choose from. 

Currently no safety checks on logic are performed. It is possible when randomizing you could generate a seed you cannot complete. This will hopefully be addressed in the future. Currently combining the preset Guarded O.G. or Lycanthrope with SOTN_AR using the Gravity Boots starting relic will avoid softlock situations. 

Check PPFHelp.txt if you need help setting up the PPF patch feature.

Best when used with the Randomizer project at https://sotn.io

SOTN_AR is programmed in C using DevCpp + TDM-GCC 4.9.2 32-Bit.
